            <h2>Introduction to Sociology</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Sociology is the scientific study of social structures, human relationships, and behaviors.</p>
            
            <h3>Differences between sociology and psychology:</h3>
            <p>Sociology examines group behavior, while psychology focuses on individual behavior.</p>
            
            <h3>The Sociological Imagination (C. Wright Mills):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ability to view society as an outsider.</li>
                <li>Distinguishes between personal troubles (micro-level) and public issues (macro-level).</li>
                <li>Example: Obesity is not just a personal issue but a societal problem influenced by industrial food production.</li>
            </ul>

                <div class="answer">Sociological imagination is the ability to connect personal experiences to larger societal issues. It helps us see how individual problems (like unemployment) may actually reflect broader social structures (economic recession, job market changes).</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Origins of Sociology</h2>
            <h3>The Enlightenment (1750-1800) and its impact on sociology:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Emphasis on reason, equality, liberty, and progress.</li>
                <li>Inspired the French Revolution, which led to changes in government and social structures.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Industrial Revolution (18th century) and its impact:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Urbanization, factory work, and mechanization led to rapid social changes.</li>
                <li>Social problems: Overcrowding, crime, pollution, and harsh working conditions.</li>
                <li>New social theories emerged to explain these changes.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Key Sociologists -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Sociologists and Their Theories</h2>
            
            <h3>Auguste Comte (1798-1857) – Father of Sociology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed Positivism: The idea that society should be studied scientifically.</li>
                <li>Law of Three Stages:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Theological Stage – Society explained by religion.</li>
                        <li>Metaphysical Stage – Society explained by abstract ideas.</li>
                        <li>Scientific (Positive) Stage – Society explained using scientific methods.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) – Social Darwinism</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Society operates like a biological system where institutions function like organs.</li>
                <li>Applied evolutionary theory to society: "Survival of the fittest."</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Émile Durkheim (1858-1917) – Social Facts & Solidarity</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Society shapes individual behavior through social facts.</li>
                <li>Types of Social Solidarity:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mechanical Solidarity – Found in traditional societies, based on shared values.</li>
                        <li>Organic Solidarity – Found in modern societies, based on interdependence.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Suicide Theory – Identified four types of suicide:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Egoistic – Due to isolation/lack of social ties.</li>
                        <li>Altruistic – Over-commitment to a group (e.g., suicide bombers).</li>
                        <li>Anomic – Result of social instability (e.g., economic crises).</li>
                        <li>Fatalistic – Due to excessive regulation (e.g., prisoners).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Max Weber (1864-1920) – Bureaucracy & Rationalization</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduced the Ideal Type: A model for evaluating real-world social structures.</li>
                <li>Focused on bureaucracy as a system of efficient organization.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Karl Marx (1818-1883) – Conflict Theory</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Class Struggle: Society is divided into two classes:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bourgeoisie (owners of production)</li>
                        <li>Proletariat (working class)</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Predicted that capitalism would lead to revolution by the working class.</li>

                <div class="question">Compare Durkheim's Mechanical vs. Organic Solidarity.</div>
                <button class="show-answer">Show Answer ✨</button>
                <div class="answer">Mechanical solidarity is found in simple, traditional societies where people share similar values and lifestyles. Organic solidarity is found in complex, modern societies where people are interdependent through specialized roles (like workers in a factory depending on each other's different skills).</div>

            <h2>Major Theoretical Perspectives</h2>
            
            <h3>Functionalist Perspective (Durkheim, Parsons, Spencer):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Society is a system where each part serves a function.</li>
                <li>Example: Education trains individuals for jobs.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Conflict Perspective (Marx, Weber):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Society is driven by competition and power struggles between groups.</li>
                <li>Example: The rich exploit the poor.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Symbolic Interactionism (Mead, Blumer):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Society is shaped by symbols and interactions.</li>
                <li>Example: The meaning of hand gestures differs across cultures.</li>
