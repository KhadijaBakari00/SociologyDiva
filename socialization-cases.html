            <h3>What is Socialization?</h3>
            <p>The lifelong process where individuals learn values, norms, behaviors, and social skills necessary for society.</p>

                <h4>Key Cases of Social Isolation</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Isabelle (1938):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Isolated for first 6 years with only her deaf-mute mother</li>
                    <li>Initially behaved like a wild animal (scored as infant on tests)</li>
                    <li>With therapy, reached 6th-grade level by age 14</li>
                    <li><em>Takeaway:</em> Shows potential for recovery with intensive socialization</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Genie (1970s):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Locked in room from 20 months to age 14</li>
                    <li>Never developed full language despite therapy</li>
                    <li><em>Takeaway:</em> Critical period for language development exists</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Romanian Orphanages (1990s):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Children left in cribs 18-20 hours/day with minimal care</li>
                    <li>Showed fear of human contact and antisocial behavior</li>
                    <li><em>Takeaway:</em> Emotional neglect causes lasting damage</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Nature vs. Nurture Debate</h3>
            <p>Modern consensus: Both genetics (nature) and environment (nurture) interact to shape development.</p>
            
            <h3>Twin Studies: Oskar & Jack</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Identical twins separated at birth</li>
                <li>Oskar raised in Nazi Germany, Jack by Jewish father in Trinidad</li>
                <li>Shared mannerisms (storing rubber bands, flushing toilets before use)</li>
                <li>Different political views and cultural habits</li>
                <li><em>Takeaway:</em> Genetics influence temperament, but socialization shapes values</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üß† Theories of the Self</h2>
            
            <h3>Cooley ‚Äì Looking-Glass Self</h3>
            <p>We develop self-image through 3 steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Imagine how we appear to others</li>
                <li>Imagine their judgment of us</li>
                <li>Develop feelings (pride/shame) based on perceived judgment</li>
            </ol>
            <p><em>Even incorrect perceptions shape identity!</em></p>
            
            <h3>Mead ‚Äì Stages of the Self</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparatory Stage:</strong> Imitation without understanding (infants)</li>
                <li><strong>Play Stage:</strong> Role-taking through pretend play (toddlers)</li>
                <li><strong>Game Stage:</strong> Understands multiple social roles (age 8-9)</li>
            </ul>
