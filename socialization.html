            <h2>📌 Key Concepts</h2>
            
            <h3>What is Socialization?</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The lifelong process where individuals learn attitudes, values, and behaviors appropriate for their society.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Identity:</strong> Our self-concept is shaped through socialization—how we see ourselves and how others see us.</p>
            
            <h3>Nature vs. Nurture Debate:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Traits we are born with (heredity).</li>
                <li><strong>Nurture:</strong> Traits acquired through experiences (environment).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="case-study">
                <h4>Case Studies on Isolation & Importance of Socialization</h4>
                <p><strong>Isabelle (1938):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lived in isolation for 6 years in a dark room with no social contact.</li>
                    <li>Initially behaved like an infant but later developed language skills and improved socially.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Genie (1970s):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Kept in isolation from 20 months to 14 years.</li>
                    <li>After rescue, she never fully developed language abilities, proving that socialization is crucial in early development.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Primate Studies (Harry Harlow, 1971)</h3>
            <p>Harlow's rhesus monkey experiment showed that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monkeys raised in isolation became fearful, withdrawn, and abusive parents.</li>
                <li>Monkeys preferred soft cloth-covered surrogates over wire ones that provided food, proving that affection is more important than basic survival needs.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Heredity & Identical Twins</h3>
            <p><strong>Case of Oskar Stohr & Jack Yufe:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>One was a Nazi supporter, the other worked in the Israeli army.</li>
                <li>Despite different upbringings, they shared similar habits, voice patterns, and intelligence, showing that both genes and environment shape identity.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Theories of the Self -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>🧠 Theories of the Self & Socialization</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Charles Cooley – "Looking-Glass Self"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Our self-image is based on how we believe others see us.</li>
                <li>Example: If a teacher criticizes you, you may think "I am stupid", even if it's not true.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. George Herbert Mead – Stages of the Self</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparatory Stage (Infancy):</strong> Imitating others.</li>
                <li><strong>Play Stage (Toddlerhood):</strong> Role-taking through pretend play (e.g., pretending to be a teacher).</li>
                <li><strong>Game Stage (Ages 8-9):</strong> Understanding multiple roles in society (e.g., teamwork in baseball).</li>
                <li><strong>Generalized Other (Ages 10+):</strong> Considering how society as a whole views actions (e.g., "What would society think if I cheat on a test?").</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Erving Goffman – Dramaturgical Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We act like performers in a play, changing our behavior based on social settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Face-work:</strong> Efforts to avoid embarrassment (e.g., pretending to be busy when a boss walks by).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4. Sigmund Freud – Psychological Theory of the Self</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The self has opposing forces: Biological urges (pleasure-seeking) vs. Society's rules (self-control).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Life Course & Socialization Stages -->

                <li>Reorientation (adjusting to a new routine)</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>3. Anticipatory Socialization & Resocialization</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anticipatory Socialization:</strong> Practicing future roles (e.g., job internships).</li>
                <li><strong>Resocialization:</strong> Learning new behaviors (e.g., military training).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Total Institutions (Goffman, 1961):</strong> Places where all aspects of life are controlled (e.g., prisons, monasteries).</p>
