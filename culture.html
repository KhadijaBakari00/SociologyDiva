            <h2>📌 Key Concepts</h2>
            
            <h3>1. What is Culture?</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Culture is the totality of learned, socially transmitted customs, knowledge, material objects, and behavior.</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "Culture is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, customs, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society." — E.B. Tylor
            </div>
            
            <h4>Culture vs. Society:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Culture</strong> = Shared customs, values, and material objects</li>
                <li><strong>Society</strong> = A group of people who share a culture and live in the same territory</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. Cultural Universals (George Murdock)</h3>
            <p><strong>Cultural Universals:</strong> Common cultural elements found in all societies (e.g., marriage, language, religious rituals, cooking, personal names).</p>
            <p>However, these elements vary in expression.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Marriage exists in all societies, but in some, parents arrange it, while in others, individuals choose their partners.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Ethnocentrism & Cultural Relativism</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ethnocentrism:</strong> The belief that one's own culture is superior.
                    <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> Westerners judging Hindu culture for considering cows sacred.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Relativism:</strong> Understanding a culture from its own perspective rather than judging it.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4. Cultural Variation & Subcultures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Subculture:</strong> A distinct cultural group within a larger society that shares unique customs and traditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Argot:</strong> A specialized language/slang used by a subculture.
                    <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> Gamers, doctors, and hackers each have their own argot.</li></ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>5. The Role of Language in Culture</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Language is the foundation of every culture.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Capital:</strong> The knowledge and education a person has, which affects their status in society.
                    <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> Knowing multiple languages or classical art can increase cultural capital.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Language shapes reality:
                    <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> The Sami people (Northern Europe) have many words for snow, meaning they perceive it in ways others do not.</li></ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>6. Symbols & Nonverbal Communication</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Symbols:</strong> Objects, gestures, or words with meaning.
                    <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> A gold star sticker represents success.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Nonverbal Communication:</strong>
                    <ul><li>Facial expressions, body language, and gestures vary by culture.</li></ul>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>8. Cultural Change & Technology</h3>

                <li><strong>Example:</strong> The internet transformed communication and social relationships</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Hunting & Gathering Societies</strong> – Small, nomadic groups relying on nature</li>

                    <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> Small villages where everyone knows each other</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Gesellschaft (Modern Society):</strong> Impersonal, professional relationships
                    <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> A city where people interact for business rather than personal connections</li></ul>
                </li>
